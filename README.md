# Battleship-udp-java

Hello human (or not)!

This code was builded for a college class and I have created this repository for my own versioning.

The project deals with a battleship implementation using datagrams and java language

Initialy builded on a single java class, the game has issues on the turn loop

Last but not least, i've used this Java Progressive article for help me on how to build the board: http://www.progressivejava.net/2012/10/Battleship-game-in-Java--How-to-Program25.html

##Next Work
I will separate the functions on specialized classes and build a graphic interface. 

Hope it's useful to someone =]
